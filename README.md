# Used Car Price Predictor
## Introduction
This project implements a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of used cars based on various features. By leveraging historical data on car specifications, mileage, and other relevant factors, the model aims to provide accurate price estimates, helping both buyers and sellers make informed decisions in the used car market.


## Technology Used
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* Flask
* html
* sklearn
* Git
* jupyter lab
* Vscode
## Features
* Data Preprocessing:This project includes data collection , data analyis,`Log-Transformation`,`feature scaling` and `one hot encoding` for categorical data.
* Model Selection:Various regression models are evaluated,including `Linear regression`,`KNN`,`L1 & L2`,`Random Forest` to determine the best performing algorithm for price prediction.
* Performance Metrics:use `MSE`,`RMSE`,`R2Square`to ensure reliable prediction.
* Web Application: A user friendly web app built with `Flask` allow user to input car details and recieve instantaneous price prediction.
## Final Report
* Accuracy of the best_model(`Random forest`) is `94%`
* `MSE` is `3%`
